/**

    Notes:

    - uint16_t is preferred over size_t because long is never needed by the
    size of the packets or the buffers of this application.
    (Kees Bakker does not agree with this. size_t is not the same as long.
    On AVR a size_t is uint16_t. On SAMD we don't care too much about the
    data size, a long is fine.)
    - Currently, only one received packet is supported. Every time a packet is
    received, the previous one is overwritten.
    - Also multiple responses from the server (with Frame Pending Bit set) are
    not supported.
    - The port of the received packet is not returned.
